# CV_FP1

Name: Juan Diego Chu Peramas
Code: 

The current project contains the following structure: 

1. Implementation done using numpy and python. 
    - For the first implementation I implemented a class called mlp with the required functions, initializer and variables. 
    - There is a second file called functions where the activation functions, derivatives and loss function are declared. 
    - On the notebook main.ipynb is the main notebook where the model calls its functions to train itself using mini batch gradient descent and cross entropy loss. 
    - The model generated is saved in models_self_implementation folder

2. Implementation using torch 
    - The implementation using torch is more simple as it is using a predefined library. 
    - The main declaration and training of the model is done in Pytorch_implementation.ipynb 
    - The model generated is saved in model_torch_implementation folder

3. There is a yaml file attached in the project with the required dependencies and libraries used in the conda environment
